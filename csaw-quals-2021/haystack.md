The only vulnerability I caught was an underflow in the haystack check -- it checked the upper bound but not the lower bound so we could guess any location on the stack. It also displays 4 bytes at the guessed location. I guessed with a negative number to leak the randomly generated location for the needle and then guessed that location.
